## Double Key Takeoff Control Panel:

The Double Key Takeoff Control Panel has two unique key switches wired in series to an Arduino. When the Arduino detects that circuit is complete (meaning both keys have turned), it activates a rainbow sequence of WS2811 LEDs. The design could be improved with sound.
