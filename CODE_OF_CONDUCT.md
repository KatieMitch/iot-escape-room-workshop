#Code of Conduct

Mozilla's [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) help us create a friendly, safe space for our shared work. They include expected behaviors and unacceptable behaviors. They include all the spaces we might share during this event and all the dimensions of diversity we hold here together.

## Expected behaviors

- Be respectful.
- Be direct, but professional.
- Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences.
- Lead by example.

## Unacceptable behaviors

- Violence or threats of violence.
- Personal attacks.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact.
- Disruptive behavior.
- Derogatory language.
- Influencing unacceptable behavior.

## Reporting incidents

Be sure to name safety officers for your event and explain how participants can make reports about incidents at your event or in your cmmunity. 

It helps to have multiple, diverse safety officers. These officers should take on-site reports and respond to them. They can also contact and work with any other safety leads in your organization as necessary.

If you are running a Mozilla event, you can also report incidents to inclusion@mozilla.com.

## Other safety considerations

Consider sharing widely applicable safety tools like these:

- **Womp womp:** Say, "Womp womp," whenever a speaker needs to explain an idea further or stop using jargon.
- **The 1/nth rule:** Remind people that in a group of n participants, they should each speak only 1/nth of the time.
- **Yes and:** Remind people to work hard to provide additive, constructive criticism, builing off of one anothers ideas instead of attacking them. For example, someone might say, "We should do X," and then someone who has an idea about how to go further or improve that idea might say, "Yes, and then we could do Y to add even more value for audience Z."
- **Avoid interruptions:** Remind people to work hard not to interrupt and to be thoughtful about making a few, essential, unique contributions to conversations instead of responding to everything.

You should also remind people:

- Where the restrooms are.
- Where the emergency exits are.
- To take breaks for self care whenever they need them.

Be aware of the dynamics in the room or at your event and prepare to answer questions and work towards resolution of issues like - but not limited to - mansplaining or microaggressions that might happen within your event community.
